        <h1>What is so special about Handmade Bookmarks?</h1>
        <p>Handmade Bookmarks are a concept created after a lot of trial and error. Our artists craft some of the best bookmarks based on consumer requests using the best colors and paints. They then go through the testing department's views and are then sold to you. There are many different designs of this type of bookmark. We sell anime sketched bookmarks, cricket/sport bookmarks, wilderness bookmarks, and even nature bookmarks.</p>
